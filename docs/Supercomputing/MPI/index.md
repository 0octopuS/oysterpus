# MPI

## Introduction

ðŸ”˜ **What is MPI?**

Programs pass messages through some processes in order to finish parallel tasks. In practice, it's easy to implement parallel tasks by MPI. For example manager process can send a message to describe a new job, and assign the job to the latter.

ðŸ”˜ **Concepts in MPI**

- **communicator**: define a set of processes which can send message to each other
- **rank**: inside a communicator, each of the process has a number(called rank). Processes communicate **explicitly** by specifying ranks.
- **tag**: each message has its unique tag.
