# 134. Gas Station

## Solution 1: Greedy

- The cur can travel a circle if the total amount of gas is greater than cost. `int total` record the total difference of gas and cost.
- `int cur` record the amount of gas in the car when it starts at `pos` and reached current index. If `cur < 0`, the `pos` cannot be the starting point, so it is adjust to next index.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = gas.size();
        int cur = 0, pos = 0, total = 0;
        for(int i =0; i < n; i++){
            cur = cur + gas[i] - cost[i]; // when arrive (i+1) the amount of gas
            total = total + gas[i] - cost[i];
            if(cur < 0) {
                pos = i+1;
                cur = 0;
            }
            // if(pos == -1 && gas[i] - cost[i] >= 0) pos = i;//(i+1)%n;
            
        }

        return total < 0 ? -1 : pos;
    }
};
