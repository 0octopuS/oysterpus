# Evolution of Transport-Layer Functionality

TCP has many version, CUBIC and CTCP are more widely deployed than classic Reno.

The only common features of these TCP protocols is that they use the TCP segment format.

## 1. QUIC: Quick UDP Internet Connections

QUIC is a new **application-layer protocol** designed from the ground up to improve the performance of transport-layer services for secure HTTP.

QUIC using **UDP** as its underlying transport-layer protocol, **HTTP/3** will natively incorporate QUIC.

Main features:

- **Connection-Oriented and Secure**
    - handshake, encrypted when connected.
    - In compare, TCP establishment and TLS establishment are separated.
- **Streams**:
    - multiplexing several application-layer streams in a single QUIC connection.
    - new streams can be added quickly.
    - connection ID + stream ID.
- **Reliable, TCP-friendly congestion-controlled data transfer**
    - QUIC provides a reliable in-order delivery on a per-stream basis
    - QUIC provides reliable data transfer using acknowledgment mechanisms similar to TCPâ€™s.
    - QUIC's congestion control is based on TCP NewReno
