# Overview of transport layer

The aim of transport layer:

- Implemented in the **end-systems**, not routers.
- Provide for **logical communication** between application processes, which means the ignorance of any physical infrastructure.
- Convert the application-layer messages it receives from a sending application process into transport-layer **packets**(or transport-layer **segments**).

## 1. Relationship Between Transport and Network Layers

- Network:   logical communication between **hosts**, often provide some guarantee services.
- Transport: logical communication between **processes**, transport-layer protocols live i**n the end systems**. Intermediate routers have **nothing** to do with it.



## 2. Overview of the Transport Layer in the Internet

The most fundamental responsibility: extend host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery, which is called **transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing**.

- TCP(Transport Control Protocol): reliable
- UDP(User Datagram Protocol): unreliable
