# Principles of Congestion Control


## 1. The Causes and the Costs of Congestion

- $\lambda_{in}$: The sender sending rate of original data(byte/sec)
- $\lambda'_{in}$(offered load): The Sender sending rate of original data & retransmit data(byte/sec)
- $\lambda_{out}$: The router sending rate of original data(byte/sec)

- **per-connection throughput**: number of bytes per second at the receiver

!!! tip "TakeAway"
    Type of packets in the Network:

    - Original packets
    - Retransmitted packets for lost(dropped) packet
    - Retransmitted packets for delay(queued) packet

    Congestion control goal: 

### 1.1 Scenario 1: Two Senders, a Router with Infinite Buffers

> The most ideal scenarios: the buffer space is **infinite**.

Consider Two hosts (A and B) each have a connection that shares a single hop between source and destination:

- For a sending rate between $0$ and $\frac{R}{2}$, the throughput at the receiver **equals the sender‚Äôs sending rate**
- **Everything** sent by the sender is received at the receiver with a finite delay.
- When the sending rate is above $\frac{R}{2}$, however, the throughput is **only** $\frac{R}{2}$.

üí≠ Reason of $\frac{R}{2}$: the sharing of link capacity between two connections.

‚ùå The delay become larger when the sending rate approach $\frac{R}{2}$. If it exceed $\frac{R}{2}$, the delay is infinite.

### 1.2 Scenario 2: Two Senders and a Router with Finite Buffers

> The amount of router buffering is assumed to be finite. When exceeding the capacity of router, new packets will be dropped and retransmitted.


If the sender has **perfect knowledge**, it sends packets only when the router has free space, then $\lambda_{in} = \lambda'_{out}$. No loss occur.

If the sender retransmits only when a packet is known **for certain** to be lost and $\lambda_{out} = \frac{R}{3}$.

- When $\lambda'_{in}$ is small, there is almost no retransmission, the $\lambda_{out}$ is roughly equals to $\lambda'_{in}$.
- When $\lambda'_{in}$ approaches $\frac{R}{2}$, retransmission packet may be retransmit. In $\frac{R}{2}$ packets transmitted, $0.333R$ bytes/sec (on average) are original data and $0.166R$ bytes/sec (on average) are retransmitted data.

---

If sender time out **prematurely** and retransmit a packet that has been **delayed in the queue** but n**ot yet lost**. Unneeded retransmissions occurs.

- In extreme case, each packets is transmitted **twice**. So $\lambda_{out} = \frac{R}{4}$

## 2. Approaches to Congestion Control


Two approach:

- **End-to-end congestion control**: TCP mechanism, indicate by segment loss / delay, manipulate window size.
- **Network-assisted congestion control**: routers provide explicit feedback.
