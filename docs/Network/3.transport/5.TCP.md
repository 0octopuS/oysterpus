# Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP

## 1. The TCP Connection

- connection-oriented
- full-duplex service
- point-to-point
- three-way handshake


## 2. TCP Segment Structure

- `Seq num`: The first **transmitted byte** index in whole message, started from a random number.
- `Ack num`: The `Seq num` the **next byte** receiver expected to receive from sender.

## 3. Round-Trip Time Estimation and Timeout

- timeout/retransmit mechanism
- round-trip time (RTT)

> ‚ùî How to decide timeout?

### 3.1 Estimating the Round-Trip Time

`SampleRTT`: the amount of time between when the segment is sent and the acknowledgement is received.

Most TCP implementation only estimate `SampleRTT` **once** and use that value.

TCP maintains an average, called `EstimatedRTT`, of the `SampleRTT` values. Upon obtaining a new SampleRTT, TCP updates `EstimatedRTT` according to the following formula:

```python
EstimatedRTT = (1 ‚Äì Œ±) * EstimatedRTT + Œ± * SampleRTT
```

This average method is called **exponential weighted moving average (EWMA)**, because each `SampleRTT`'s influence decays exponentially.

`DevRTT` is an EWMA of the difference between `SampleRTT` and `EstimatedRTT`.

```python
DevRTT = (1 ‚Äì Œ≤) * DevRTT + Œ≤ * abs(SampleRTT ‚Äì EstimatedRTT)
```

> Recommend: $\alpha=0.125, \beta = 0.25$

### 3.2 Setting and Managing the Retransmission Timeout Interval

It is therefore desirable to set the timeout equal to the `EstimatedRTT` plus some margin.

The margin should be larger when the fluctuation is large. Therefore the margin is related to `DevRTT`.

!!! note "TCP timeout"
    ```python
    TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT
    ```

## 4. Reliable Data Transfer

- The recommended TCP standard uses only **a single timer**, which is Go-Back-N method.

There are 3 major event in TCP:

- Data receive from above layer
    - create segment with `NextSeqNum`
    - start timer
    - pass segment to IP
    - increase `NextSeqNum += length(data)`
- Timeout
    - retransmit
    - restart timer
- Receive `ACK`
    - if `AckNum > SendBase`, then `SendBase=AckNum`, start timer
    - else ignore


### 4.1 Doubling the timeout interval

> ‚ùî Should the length of the timeout interval after a timer expiration be modified

TCP do the following:

- **Timeout occurs**: Each time TCP retransmits, it sets the next **timeout interval** to **twice** the previous value.
- **Two other events occur**: Whenever the **timer is started** after either of the two other events, the `TimeoutInterval` is derived from the most recent values of `EstimatedRTT` and `DevRTT`.


### 4.2 Fast Retransmit

> ‚ùî Timeout period can be relatively long

The sender can often detect packet loss well before the timeout event occurs by noting so-called **duplicate ACKs**.

In the case that **3 duplicate ACKs** are received, the TCP sender performs a fast retransmit

### 4.3 Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat?

A hybrid of GBN and SR protocols.

Many TCP implementations will **buffer** correctly received but out-of-order
segments. Still they use a cumulative acknowledgement.

## 5. Flow Control

> ‚ùîIf the application is relatively slow at reading the data, the sender can very easily overflow the connection‚Äôs receive buffer by sending too much data too quickly.

- **flow-control service**: to eliminate the possibility of the sender **overflowing** the receiver‚Äôs buffer. It's a speed match service.

TCP do flow control by:

- `RcvBuffer`: The sender maintain a variable called the **receive window**(free buffer space is available at the receiver).
- `LastByteRead`: The last byte receiver read.
- `LastByteRcvd`: The last byte receiver received.
- `LastByteRcvd - LastByteRead < RcvBuffer`
- remain receive window size: `rwnd = RcvBuffer ‚Äì [LastByteRcvd ‚Äì LastByteRead]`
- Sender keeps the amount of
unacknowledged data less than the value of `rwnd`.
- When `rwnd=0`, sender sends 1 byte data to ensure itself not be blocking.

## 6. TCP Connection Management

> ‚ùî Problem in TCP connection establishment
>
> - TCP connection establishment can significantly add to perceived delays.
> - Also cause attacks like SYN flood

### TCP connection and disconnection

üîò TCP connection steps:

1. SYN segment: `[SYN_bit = 1, SYN = c]`, in an IP datagram, no application-layer data
2. SYNACK segment: `[SYN_bit = 1, ACK_bit = 1, SYN = s, ACK = c + 1]`, server allocates the TCP buffers and variables
3. ACK segment: `[SYN_bit = 0, SYN = c + 1, ACK = s + 1]`, may carry client-toserver
data in the segment payload.

üîò TCP disconnection steps:

- **Either** of the two processes participating in a TCP connection can end the connection.
- `FIN` - `ACK` - `FIN` - `ACK`

### 6.2 TCP state

TCP client state:

TCP server state:

- If server receive a package's IP address doesn't match any on-going connection, it will send an **RST** package.
