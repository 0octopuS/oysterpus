# Connectionless Transport: UDP

UDP is a no-frills, bare-bones transport protocol, only provide a **multiplexing/demultiplexing** service in order to **pass data** between the network layer and the **correct** application-level process.

!!! note "UDP advantages"
    - Finer **application-level control** over **what** data is sent, and **when**.
    - No connection establishment **delay**.
    - No connection **state**, servers are easier to support many more active clients.
    - Small packet header overhead, 20 bytes for TCP, 8 bytes for UDP.

❌ But he lack of congestion control in UDP can result in **high loss rates** between a UDP sender and receiver, and the crowding out of TCP sessions.

## 1.UDP Segment Structure

The UDP header has only four fields, each consisting of two bytes.

- `length`: the number of bytes in the UDP segment (header plus data).
- `checksum`: calculated over **a few of the fields in the IP header** and **UDP segment**.

## 2. UDP Checksum

The checksum is used to determine whether bits **within the UDP segment** have been altered.

!!! note "checksum process"
    - Sender: **sum** of all the 16-bit words in the segment, with any overflow encountered during the sum being wrapped around.
    - Receiver: all four 16-bit words are added, including the checksum. Result should be 1111111111111111.


!!! question "Why UDP has checksum when link layer provide similar thing?"
    - there is **no guarantee** that all the links between source and destination provide error checking.
    - bit errors could be introduced when a segment is stored in a **router’s** memory


!!! warning
    Checksum can only provide a **weak** protection. It is designed to detect possible transit error, not carefully designed one.
