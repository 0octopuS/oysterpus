# Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

A multiplexing/demultiplexing service is needed for all computer networks. The service requires (1) that sockets have unique ids, and (2) that each segment have special fields that indicate the socket to which the segment is to be delivered.

- Multiplexing: gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer.
    - from socket get data chunks-> multiplexing -> network layer
- Demultiplexing: delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket.
    - from newtork layer -> demultiplexing -> socket


The source port number field and the destination port number field are identifiers of socket.

- 16-bit number, ranging from 0 to 65535
- 0 to 1023 are called well-known port numbers and are restricted

## 1. Connectionless Multiplexing and Demultiplexing(UDP)\

```Python
clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
```

When a UDP socket is created, a unique port number(1024 to 65535) is assigned automatically.

The port number can also manully specified.

```Python
clientSocket.bind((’’, 19157))
```

UDP socket is fully identified by a **two-tuple** consist
ing of a `(destination IP address, destination port number)`.

## 2. Connection-Oriented Multiplexing and Demultiplexing(TCP)

TCP socket is identified by a four-tuple: `(source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number)`

## 3. Web Servers and TCP

High-performing Web servers often use only **one process**, and create a new **thread** with a new connection socket for each new client connection.
