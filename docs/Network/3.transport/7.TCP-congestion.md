# TCP Congestion Control

## 1. Classic TCP Congestion Control

TCP does congestion control by limiting sender's rate.

> ‚ùî How to limit rate?

Sender keeps an additional variable: `cwnd`(congestion window). It imposes a constraint on the **rate** at which a TCP sender can send traffic into the network.

```python
LastByteSent ‚Äì LastByteAcked = min{cwnd, rwnd}
```

By limiting the amount of **unacknowledged segment**, TCP can limit sender's send rate. 

The sender's send rate is roughly ``cwnd/RTT`` bytes/sec.
> ‚ùî How to perceive congestion?

When timeout or 3 duplicate ACK packages occur, the congestion must be large.

TCP is **self-clocking**. When ACKs arrive, which means the packages arrive at destination, then the `cwnd` should increase. The increase size should link to ACKs arrive rate. 

> ‚ùî What algorithm can be used to calculate new rate?

Some principles:

- A **lost** segment implies congestion, and hence, the TCP sender‚Äôs rate should be
**decreased** when a segment is lost.
- An **acknowledged** segment indicates that the network is delivering the sender‚Äôs
segments to the receiver, and hence, the sender‚Äôs rate can be **increased** when an
ACK arrives for a previously unacknowledged segment.
- Bandwidth probing: probe for the rate that at which congestion onset begins, backs off from that rate

üîò Slow Start

`cwnd` begins at a small value of **1 MSS**, resulting in an initial sending rate of roughly **MSS/RTT**.

In Slow Start state, `cwnd` increase 1 MSS every time when receive an ACK. `cwnd=cwnd+MSS`

This process results in a **doubling** of the
sending rate every RTT.

When will slow start ends?


- If there is a **loss** event indicated by a **timeout**, the TCP sender sets the value of to 1 and begins the slow start `cwnd` process **anew**. It also sets the value of a second state variable, `ssthresh` (slow start threshold) to `cwnd/2`, half of the value of the congestion window value when congestion was detected.
- If slow start rate arrived `ssthresh`(`cwnd >= ssthresh`),  ‚û°Ô∏è congestion avoidance mode.
- If 3 duplicated ACKs are received, ‚û°Ô∏è fast transmitted mode

üîò Congestion Avoidance

In congestion avoidance mode, TCP increases the value of `cwnd` by just **a single MSS** every RTT. `cwnd=cwnd+ MSS *(MSS/cwnd)`

When will congestion avoidance ends?

- If timeout occurs, `ssthresh=cwnd/2, cwnd=1 MSS`‚û°Ô∏è slow start state
- If 3 duplicated ACKs are received, `ssthresh` should be decreased, `ssthresh= cwnd/2, cwnd=ssthresh+3*MSS`‚û°Ô∏è fast recovery state.

üîò Fast recovery

In fast recovery, the value of cwnd is increased by `1 MSS` for every duplicate
ACK received for the **missing segment** that caused TCP to enter the fast-recovery
state. `cwnd=cwnd+MSS`

- If timeout occurs, `ssthresh=cwnd/2, cwnd=1 MSS`‚û°Ô∏è slow start state
- If new ACK received, cwnd=ssthresh, ‚û°Ô∏è fast transmitted mode

- TCP Tahoe(early version): unconditionally
cut its congestion window to 1 MSS and entered the slow-start phase when loss event
- TCP Reno(newer version): fast recovery.


### 1.2 Analysis

TCP congestion control is often referred to as an **additive-increase multiplicative-decrease(AIMD)** form of congestion control.

When the window size is `w` bytes and the current round-trip time is `RTT` seconds,then TCP‚Äôs transmission rate is roughly `w/RTT`.

TCP then probes for additional bandwidth by increasing `w` by `1 MSS` each `RTT` until a loss event occurs.

TCP transmission rate ranges from `W/(2 * RTT)` to `W/RTT`.

Average throughput of a connection`0.75 * W/RTT`.
