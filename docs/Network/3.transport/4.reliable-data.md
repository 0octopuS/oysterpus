# Principles of Reliable Data Transfer

Main task: How to transfer reliable data(no packet loss, no bit error, in order, etc.) when the layer below are unreliable.

## 1. Building a Reliable Data Transfer Protocol

### 1.1 RDT over a Perfectly Reliable Channel: rdt1.0

The underlying channal is completely reliable. So in rdt1.0, sender and receiver are simply send/read message to/from the underlying layer.

!!! note "rdt1.0"
    - The FSM(finite-state machine) is
        <div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.reliable-data.assets\autocb_1.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>
    - no difference between a unit of data and a packet
    - receiver side need not provide **feedback**.

### 1.2 RDT over a Channel with Bit Errors: rdt2.0

The **bits** in a packet may be corrupted. It requires some control message including **positive/negative acknowledgement**.

In a computer network setting, reliable data transfer protocols based on such **retransmission** are known as **ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols**.

!!! note "ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols"
    - reliable data transfer protocols based on such **retransmission** are known as **ARQ**.
    - Requires 3 capabilities:
        - Error detection: by redundant bits
        - Receiver feedback: explicit ACK and NAK message
        - Retransmission


!!! note "rdt2.0"
    - FSM state:
        <div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.reliable-data.assets\autocb_2.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>
    - **stop-and-wait** protocols
    - ❌ ACK or NAK packet could be **corrupted**!

A simple and common solution to this corrupted problem is to add a **new field**. In this case a **sequence number** field, and for rdt2.0's stop-and-wait scenario, 1-bit seq is enough.

### 1.3 RDT over a Lossy Channel with Bit Errors: rdt3.0

The underlying channel can lose packets as well, a not-uncommon event in today’s computer networks.

>❔how to **detect** packet loss?
>❔what to do when packet loss occurs?

❇️ **Solution**: Sender picks a certain time which packets are likely loss if receiver doesn't respond. Sender waits until **countdown timer** passed, then **retransmits**.

> ❔ What about **duplicate packets**?

❇️ **Solution**: Same as RDT2.1, make sequence numbers and drop same packet.

!!! note "rdt3.0"
    - FSM state:
        <div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.reliable-data.assets\autocb_5.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>
    - Packet sequence numbers alternate between 0 and 1, protocol rdt3.0 sometimes known as the **alternating-bit protocol**.

## 2. Pipelined Reliable Data Transfer Protocols

> ❌ rdt3.0: slow performance because stop-and-wait.



❇️ Solution: **pipelining**. rather than operate in a stop-and-wait manner, the sender is allowed to send **multiple packets without waiting** for acknowledgments.

Pipelining consequences(or things that protocol needs to change):

- Increased SEQ number: multiple packets, unique number.
- Both side buffer: to hold correctly received packets.
- Error recovery method: [Go-Back-N](#3go-back-n-gbn) and ][selective repeat](#4selective-repeat-sr).

## 3.Go-Back-N (GBN)

Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol：

- the sender is allowed to transmit **multiple packets** (when available) without waiting for an acknowledgment
- is constrained to have no more than some **maximum allowable number** $N$, of unacknowledged packets in the pipeline.
- known as **sliding-window protocol**, $N$ is the **window size**.


!!! note "GBN explain"
    - `base`: the sequence number of the oldest unacknowledged packet
    - `nextseqnum`: the smallest unused sequence number
    <div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.reliable-data.assets\autocb_6.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>
    
    - `[0,base)`, have sent, have ack
    - `[base,nextseqnum)`, have sent, no ack
    - `[nextseqnum,base + N)`, no sent, can be sent immediately
    - `[base+N,...)`, can not be sent


The window slides forward over the sequence number space.

SEQ number are in the ring of size $2^k$, in TCP, $k = 32$.

Sender's FSM:
<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.reliable-data.assets\autocb_7.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

Receiver's FSM:
<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.reliable-data.assets\autocb_8.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

The GBN sender must **respond** to three types of events:

1. Invocation from above: check whether the windows are full, send, buffer or return the message
2. Receipt of an ACK: SEQ number is cumulative acknowledgment. When received ana ACK, timer restarts.
3. Timeout: retransmit all window messages.

## 4.Selective Repeat (SR)

> ❔GBN performance problem: A single packet error can thus cause GBN to retransmit a large number of packets.

That brings to **selective-repeat** protocols which avoid unnecessary retransmissions by having the sender retransmit only those packets that it **suspects were received in error** at received.

<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.reliable-data.assets\autocb_9.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

- each packet must now have its **own** logical timer
- The SR receiver will acknowledge a **correctly received** packet whether or not it is in order. If the packets are out-of-order, they will be **buffered**.
- The sender will have already received ACKs for **some of the packets** in the window. If the packet’s sequence number is equal to **send_base**, the window base is **moved forward** to the **unacknowledged** packet with the smallest sequence number.


For SR protocols, this means that the sender and receiver windows will **not always coincide**.

The window size must be less than or **equal to half the size** of the sequence number space for SR protocols.
