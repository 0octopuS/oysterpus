## 1. ç½‘ç»œæž„é€ 

- hosts(end systems): Devices hook up to the Internet.
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs): End systems access the Internet through ISPs.(local cable/ telephone companies)
- socket interface: specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system


## 2. Network Edge

### 2.1 Access Network

- access network: the network that physically connects an end system to the first router(edge router).


ðŸ”˜ **Home access**
Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access:

- digital subscriber line(DSL): local telephone company, short distance, single use
- cable: cable television company, fast, shared use

Some other kinds:

- fiber to the home (FTTH): an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home.
- 5G fixed wireless: without cable


ðŸ”˜ **Access in the Enterprise (and the Home)**

- local area network(LAN): used to connect an end system to the edge router

LAN Types:

- Ethernet: twisted-pair copper wire, ethernet switch
- Wifi: transmit/receive packets to/from an access point

## 3. Network core

### 3.3 The network of network

ðŸ”˜ **Network Structure Type**

ðŸ”µ Network structure 1: A **single** global transit ISP

ðŸ”µ Network structure 2: **Two-tier** hierarchy, with global transit providers residing at the top tier and access ISPs at the bottom tier.

ðŸ”µ Network structure 3: **Multi-tier** hierarchy, tier1 -- regional -- access

ðŸ”µ Network structure 4: ecosystemâ€”consisting of access ISPs, regional ISPs, tier-1 ISPs, PoPs, multi-homing, peering, and IXPs

!!! note "Concepts Explain"
    1. **PoPs(Point of presence)**: a group of one or more routers (at the same location) in the providerâ€™s network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP.
    2. **multi-homes**: A lower tier ISP connect to multi provider ISPs.
    3. **peer**: Same tier ISPs directly connect their networks together so that all the traffic between them passes over the direct connection rather than through upstream intermediaries.
    4. **IXP(Internet Exchange Point)**: third-party company creates a meeting point where multiple ISPs can peer together.

ðŸ”µ Network structure 5(today): builds on top of Network Structure 4 by adding **content-provider networks**.

- For example, Google's data centers distribute across the world and interconnected to Google's private network(not public network), so that they can **bypass** the tier-1 ISP.
- By creating its own network, a content provider not only **reduces its payments to upper-tier ISPs**, but also has **greater control** of how its services are ultimately delivered to end users.

## 4. Delay

There are four types of delay in End-to-End system:

- Processing Delay
- Queuing Delay
- Transmission Delay
- Propagation Delay

## 5. Layers

Layers (1) performing certain actions within that layer and by (2) using the services of the layer directly below it.

A protocol layer can be implemented in **software**, in **hardware**, or in a combination of the two.

ðŸ”˜ These layers are:

1. Application layer

    - provide services that are frequently required by applications
    - incorporated presentation and secession layers in OSI

2. Transport layer

    - End-to-end transfer of messages
    - break long messages into shorter segments
    - port numbers enable **multiplexing**
    - congestion control
    - TCP, UDP

3. Network layer

    - transfer packets across multiple links
    - sometimes called **IP layer**
    - IP protocol, numerous routing protocols

4. Link layer

    - transfer **frames** across **direct** connections between 2nodes
    - control, addressing and error correction
    - Examples: Ethernet, WiFi, the cable access networkâ€™s DOCSIS protocol, PPP, HDLC

5. Physical layer

   - move the **individual bits** within the frame from one node to the next
   - depend on actual transmission medium
