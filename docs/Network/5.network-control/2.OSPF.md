# Intra-AS Routing in the Internet: OSPF

> ❔ Is Internet = routers +end system? Are all routers execute same routing algorithm? What are the benefits and disadvantages?
> ✅ **Scale**: number of routers grow, memory for storing routing information grows. 💭 Reduce the complexity of route computation in a network as large as Internet.
> ✅ **Administrative autonomy**: An ISP, consisting of its own routers, desires to operate its network as it pleases.


The routers are organizing into **autonomous systems(ASs)**.

- **intra-AS routing protocol**: determined entries for dst within an AS.
- **inter-AS routing protocol**: determined entries for external dst, together with intra-AS protocol.

## 1. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

OSPF is a **LS protocol** that uses flooding of LS information and a Dijkstra's least-cost path algorithm.

- Each router constructs **a complete topological map** of the entire autonomous system. They locally runs Dijkstra to determine a shortest-path tree to **all subnets**, with itself as the **root** node.
- The weight of each link is decided by admin, can have multiple link cost metrics(bandwidth, delay...)
- With OSPF, a router broadcasts routing information to **all other routers** in the AS.

### 1.1 Advance in OSPF

- **Security**: All OSPF message are authenticated.
- **Multiple same-cost paths**: When multiple paths to a destination have the same cost, OSPF allows multiple paths to be used.
- **Integrated support for unicast and multicast routing**: uses the existing OSPF link database and adds a new type of LS advertisement.
- **Support for hierarchy within a single AS.**

### 1.2 Hierarchical OSPF

Two-level: local area, backbone.

- LS advertisement flooded only in area, or backbone.
- Each node has detailed area topology; only knows direction to reach other destinations.
