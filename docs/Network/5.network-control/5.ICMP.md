# ICMP: The Internet Control Message Protocol

ICMP is used by hosts and routers to communicate **network-layer information** to each other(e.g. error reporting).

ICMP is often considered part of IP, but architecturally it lies just above IP.

ICMP messages construction:

- `type` field: type 3(destination problem); type 4(source problem); type 8(echo request)...
- `code` field: the specific kind below a `type`.
- IP info field: The first 8 bytes of the problematic IP datagrams.

!!! note "ping program"
    Ping sends a ICMP type 8 code 0 message to the specific host.
    Ping echo is a ICMP type 0 code 0.


!!! note "traceroute program"
    - request: a series of (IP + UDP) packets with unlikely UDP port number, with TTL increasing from 1.
    - reply: when nth packets arrive nth router, the router send a ICMP type 11 code 0(TTL expire).
    - when to end: the destination return a ICMP type 3 code 3(destination unreachable).
