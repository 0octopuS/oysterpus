# Routing Algorithms

!!! tips "TakeAway"
    - LS algorithm: Dijkstra to get shortest path
    - D_V algorithm: guess, then replace own guess with **neighbor's guess plus neighbor's cost**.

The goal is to determine good **paths**, from senders to receivers, through the network of routers with **the least cost**.

We use graph $G = (N,E)$ to represent the network. The **routers** are represented as a sequence of **nodes** $x_1,\dots,x_p$, while the **packet-forwarding decisions** are the **edges** $(x_1,x_2),(x_2,x_3),\dots,(x_{p-1},x_p)$.

The total cost is $c(x_1,x_2)+c(x_2,x_3),\dots+c(x_{p-1},x_p)$.

!!! note "classify routing algorithm by centralization"
    - **Centralized routing algorithm**: using a complete, global knowledge about the network. Aka, obtain information about all nodes and all link cost before calculation. ([Ls algorithm](#1-the-link-state-ls-routing-algorithm))
    - **Decentralized routing algorithm**: each node begins with only the knowledge of the costs of  its own directly attached links.([D_V algorithm](#2-the-distance-vector-d_v-routing-algorithm))

!!! note "classify routing algorithm by dynamic"
    - **Static routing algorithm**: routes change slowly, often as a result of **human intervention**.
    - **Dynamic routing algorithm**: routes change as the network traffic loads change or topology or link cost changes.

!!! note "classify routing algorithm by load-sensitivity"
    - **load-sensitive algorithm**: link costs vary dynamically to reflect the current level of congestion.
    - **load-insensitive algorithm**: link's cost does not explicitly reflect its current level of congestion.(Today's algorithm, RIP, OSPF, BGP)


## 1. The Link-State (LS) Routing Algorithm

🔘**link-state broadcast**: each node **broadcast** link-state packets to **all** other nodes in the network.

The LS routing algorithm use **Dijkstra's algorithm** to compute the least-cost path.


Link-State (LS) Algorithm for Source Node `u`:

```C++
Initialization:
    N’ = {u}
    for all nodes v
        if v is a neighbor of u
            then D(v) = c(u,v)
    else D(v) = ∞

Loop
    find w not in N’ such that D(w) is a minimum
    add w to N’
    update D(v) for each neighbor v of w and not in N’:
        D(v) = min(D(v), D(w)+ c(w,v) )
    /* new cost to v is either old cost to v or known
    least path cost to w plus cost from w to v */
until N’= N
```

The iteration if $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, the complexity if $O(n^2)$.

> ❌ Oscillation: When LS algorithm runs, and two routers find a better route, they change routes at the same time, which will centralize all the cost to one route, resulting original route a less cost one.
> 💭 ensure that not all routers run the LS algorithm at the **same time**.
> 💭 avoid such **self-synchronization** is for each router to **randomize** the time it sends out a link ad_vertisement.

# 2. The Distance-Vector (D_V) Routing Algorithm

🔘**Iterative, asynchronous, and distributed**: 

- Each node receives some information from one or more of its **directly attached** neighbors.
- Do not require all of the nodes to operate lockstep with each other.

🔘 The D_V routing algorithm use **Bellman-Ford equation** to compute the least-cost path.

$$ D_x(y) = \min_v\{c(x,v) + d_v(y)\}$$

Each node x begins with $D_x(y)$, an **estimate** of cost of the least cost path. then

- For each neighbor $v$, the cost $c(x,v)$ from $x$ to directly attached neighbor $v$.
- Node $x$’s distance vector $D_x = [D_x(y): y in N]$, containing $x$’s estimate of its cost to all destinations, $y$ in $N$.
- The distance vectors of each of its neighbors $D_v = [D$v(y): y in N]$ for each neighbor $v$.

Neighbors exchange the distance vector, and replace its own vector by

$$ D_x(y) = \min_v\{c(x,v) + d_v(y)\}$$

Distance-Vector (D_V) Algorithm

```C++
At each node, x:
Initialization:
    for all destinations y in N:
        D_x(y)= c(x,y)/* if y is not a neighbor then c(x,y)= ∞ */
    for each neighbor w
        D_w(y) = ? for all destinations y in N
    for each neighbor w
        send distance vector D_x = [D_x(y): y in N] to w
loop
    wait (until I see a link cost change to some neighbor w or
    until I receive a distance vector from some neighbor w)

    for each y in N:
        D_x(y) = min_v{c(x,v) + D_v(y)}

    if D_x(y) changed for any destination y
        send distance vector D_x = [D_x(y): y in N] to all neighbors

forever
```

> ❌ routing loop: If a $c(v,x)$ increase, it propagate to neighbor.
