# Routing Among the ISPs: BGP

BGP(Border Gateway Protocol): **Glue** that hold Internet together.

Since an inter-AS routing protocol involves coordination among multiple ASs, communicating ASs must run the **same inter-AS routing protocol**.

❗BGP is much about **policy** than **performance**.

## 1. The Role of BGP

> ❔How to route to a destination outside of the AS?

BGP allows subnet to advertise its existence, its reaching dst.

BGP provide each AS a means to:

- Obtain **prefix reachability** information from neighboring
- Determine the “best” **routes** to the prefixes.


## 2. Advertising BGP Route Information

!!! note "BGP kinds"
    - **eBGP**: external BGP, between ASs
    - **iBGP**: internal BGP, inside AS

!!! note "router kinds"
    - **gateway routers**: connected to other ASs, run both eBGP and iBGP.
    - **internal router**: connects only to hosts and routers within its own AS, run iBGP.


In BGP, pairs of routers exchange routing information over **semi-permanent TCP connections** using port **179**.

The typical BGP workflow:

- eBGP request to gateway router.
- iBGP request from gateway router to internal routers.
- eBGP response to sender.
- iBGP response to internal routers.


!!! note "BGP protocol messages"
    - `OPEN`: OPEN TCO connection and authenticate.
    - `UPDATE`: advertise new path.
    - `KEEPALIVE`: keeps connection alive, ACK OPEN request.
    - `NOTIFICATION`: reporting errors in previous msg, close connection.


## 3. Determining the Best Routes

BGP advertised path: **prefix** + **attributes**.

- prefix: destination  being advertised
- attributes
    - `AS-PATH`: list of ASs through which prefix advertisement has passed.
    - `NEXT-HOP`: indicates specific internal-AS router to next-hop AS. The `NEXT-HOP` is the IP address of the router interface that begins the `AS-PATH`.


!!! note "policy-based routing"
    - router uses **policy** to accept/reject a path(e.g., never route through AS W, or country Y).
    - router uses policy to decide whether to **advertise a path** to neighbor(does the router **want to route** traffic forward from neighbor X to Y?).

### 3.1 Hot Potato Routing

In hot potato routing, the chosen route has the **least cost** to the `NEXTHOP` router. It is a **greedy** algorithm, enabling least cost of its **own AS**, **regardless** of the end-to-end costs outside its AS.

Steps of adding an outside-AS prefix into a forwarding table(both inter/intra-AS routing protocol are used):

<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./3.BGP.assets\autocb_0.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

### 3.2 Route-Selection Algorithm(practical used)

- If there is only **one** such route, then BGP selects that route.
- If two or more, BGP do the following:
    1. A route is assigned a **local preference** value as its attributes. It's a policy decision by AS's admin.
    2. From all route with the same highest local preference value, BGP choose the shortest `AS-PATH`.
    3. From all route with the same highest local preference value and same shortest `AS-PATH`, BGP choose the closest `NEXT-HOP`(hot-potato).
    4. If three are same, the router uses BGP identifiers to determine.



## 4. IP-Anycast

BGP is often used to implement the **IP-anycast** service, which is commonly used in **DNS**.

Consider following problems:

- **replicating the same content** on different servers in many different dispersed geographical locations.
- having each user access the content from the server that is **closest**.
