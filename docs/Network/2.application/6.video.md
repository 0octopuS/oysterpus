# Video streaming and Content Distribution Network

## 1. Internet Video

A video is a sequence of images, typically being displayed at a constant rate.

Today’s off-the-shelf compression algorithms can compress a video to
essentially any bit rate desired.

## 2. HTTP Streaming and DASH

In HTTP streaming, the video is simply stored at an **HTTP server** as an ordinary **file** with a specific URL. User gets video by HTTP `GET`, and use a buffer to receive HTTP data, then reform to video.

!!! danger "Problem in same video stream"
    ❓ In HTTP Streaming, clients have different bandwidth but the video data are same.

Solution: **DASH**.

!!! note "DASH"
    In **dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP**(DASH), video is encoded into several **different versions**, with each version having a different bit rate and, correspondingly, a different quality level.

With DASH, each video version is stored in the HTTP server, each with **a different URL**.

The HTTP server also has a **manifest** file, which provides a URL for each version along with its bit rate.

## 3. Content Distribution Networks

!!! danger "Problem in HTTP Streaming"
    ❓freezing delay: the end-to-end throughput below the video consumption rate. 
    ❓hot video: transfer multiple times, waste of bandwidth, pay more to ISP.
    ❓availability: single data center represents a single point of failure

!!! note "Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)"
    A CDN manages servers in multiple **geographically distributed locations**, stores **copies** of the videos (and other types of Web content, including documents, images, and audio) in its servers, and attempts to **direct each user request** to a CDN location that will provide the best user experience.

    - private CDN: google CDN for YouTube
    - third-party CDN

CDNs have two server placement philosophies:

- Enter Deep: deploying server clusters in access network of ISPs. The goal is to get closer to user. The challenge is how to maintain and manage the clusters.
- Bring Home: building large clusters at a smaller number (for example, tens) of sites(typically IXPs). lower maintenance and management overhead, but higher delay and lower throughput.


CDN's tasks: 

- (1) determine a suitable CDN server cluster for that client at that time  [->3.2](#32-cluster-selection-strategies)
- (2) redirect the client’s request to a server in that cluster [->3.1](#31-cdn-operation)


### 3.1 CDN Operation

CDN's operation steps:

1. Users clicks video url, send a DNS request.
2. Local DNS Server relays the DNS query to an **authoritative** DNS server.
3. Instead of returning an IP address, the authoritative DNS server returns **a hostname** in CDN’s domain.
4. The user’s LDNS then sends a second query for the hostname. 
5. CDN's DNS system eventually returns the **IP addresses of a content server**.
6. The LDNS forwards the IP address of the content-serving CDN node to the user’s host. Client establishes a direct TCP connection for video.

### 3.2 Cluster Selection Strategies

!!! note "cluster selection strategy"
    a mechanism for dynamically directing clients to a server cluster or a data center within the CDN.

    - **geographically closest**: each LDNS IP address is mapped to a geographic location, CNS choose the geographically closest cluster.  
        ❓If user configures to use remote LDNS, the geographically closest method will lose efficiency.
    - **periodic real-time measurements**: send probes(ping, DNS) to measure delay and loss performance between their clusters and clients
        ❓many LDNSs are configured to not respond to such probes



## 4. Case Studies: Netflix and YouTube

### 4.1 Netflix

Netflix video distribution has two major components: the **Amazon cloud** and its own **private CDN** infrastructure.

- Content ingestion: Ingest and process the movie, upload to Amazon cloud.
- Content processing: Create many different formats for each movie, suitable for a diverse array of client video players.
- Uploading versions to its CDN

### 4.2 YouTube

Google uses its own **private CDN** to distribute YouTube videos, and has installed **server clusters** in many hundreds of different **IXP and ISP locations**.

Google uses pull caching, as described in Section [2.2.5](2.HTTP.md#5-web-caching), and DNS redirect, as described in Section [2.6.3](#31-cdn-operation).

YouTube does not employ adaptive streaming (such as DASH), but
instead requires the user to **manually select a version**.
