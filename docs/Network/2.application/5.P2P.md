# Peer-to-Peer

## 1. Scalability of P2P Architectures

Assume that:

- server/client upload rate $u_s/u_i$
- server/client download rate $d_s/d_i$
- file size $F$
- client number $N$

In **Client-Sever** architecture, theyhe time to distribute the file is bound by server upload time and client download time:

$$D_{cs} \ge \max\big\{\frac{NF}{u_s},\frac{F}{d_{min}}\big\}$$

In **P2P** architecture, when a peer receives some
file data, it can use its own **upload** capacity to redistribute the data to other peers.

$$D_{P2P}\ge \big\{\frac{F}{u_s},\frac{F}{d_{min}}, \frac{NF}{u_s + \sum_{i=1}^{N}u_i} \big\}$$

## 2. BitTorrent

A *Torrent* means the collection of all peers joint in a particular file distribution.

Peers in a torrent download **equal-size chunks** of the file from one another, with a typical chunk size of 256 KBytes. Any peer can leaves a torrent **with or without** enough trunks.

Each torrent has an infrastructure node called a **tracker**.

- Alice registers itself and inform to track that it is still in torrent.
- Tracker randomly selects a **subset** of peers, and send their IP addresses to Alice. They form a TCP connection, which is called **neighboring peers**.(Since peers may leave, the neighbor are fluctuated.)
- Alice can ask for trunks from her neighbor.
- **rarest first**:  Alice will first asks for the chunks that have the **fewest** repeated copies among her neighbors.
- **trading algorithm**: Alice gives priority to the neighbors that are currently supplying her data at the highest rate.
