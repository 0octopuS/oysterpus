# Principles of Network Applications

## 1. Network Application Architectures

=== "Client-server"
    - clients **do not** directly communicate with each other
    - server has **a fixed, well-known IP address**
=== "Peer-to-peer"
    - **minimal (or no) reliance** on dedicated servers in data centers
    - the peers communicate **without** passing through a dedicated server
    - self-scalability

## 2. Processes Communicating

!!! note "Process"
    - **Def**: a program is running within an end system
    - Communication: 
      + interproces: governed by the end system’s **operating system**
      + different hosts: across **computer network**


!!! note "Client & Server"
    - **client**: The process that **initiates the communication** (that is, initially contacts the other process at the beginning of the session) is labeled as the client
    - **server**: The process that **waits to be contacted** to begin the session is the server.

!!! note "Interface Between the Process and Network"
    - **socket**: A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a socket.
        - the interface between the **application layer** and the **transport layer** within a host
    - **API**: Socket is also referred to as the Application Programming Interface (API) between the application and the network.

!!! Addressing Processes
    Sockets identify target receiving process by:

      1. IP address(Network layer)
      2. port number(Transport layer)

## 3. Transport Service Available to Applications

There are different transport layer protocols, providing four abilities to applications:

  
!!! note "reliable data transfer"
    - Guarantee that the data sent by one end of the application is delivered **correctly and completely** to the other end of the application.
    - ✅ loss-tolerant applications: media applications like audio/video, can tolerate some amount of data loss.
!!! note "throughput"
    - Guarantee available throughput at some **specified rate** ( $r$ bits/sec).
    - ❌ bandwidth-sensitive applications: multimedia applications, use adaptive coding techniques to **encode** digitized voice or video at a rate that matches the currently available throughput.
    - ✅ elastic applications: electronic mail, file transfer, and Web transfers and so on.
!!! note "timing"
    - Guarantee messages receives within how much time.
    - E.g: $k$ bits in $t$ sec (for real-time apps)
!!! note "security"
    - confidentiality
    - integrity

## 4. Transport Services Provided by the Internet

The Internet provide 2 transport layer protocols: **UDP** and **TCP**.

!!! note "TCP"
    - Connection-oriented service
      + handshaking
      + TCP connection between the sockets of two processes. 
    - Reliable data transfer service
      + deliver all data sent **without error** and in the **proper order**
    - congestion-control

!!! note "UDP"
    - minimal services
    - unreliable data transfer

!!! note "Services **Not** Provided by Internet Transport Protocols"
    - Encryption: TLS
    - throughput or timing guarantees

## 5. Application-Layer Protocols

An application-layer protocol defines:

- The **types** of messages exchanged
    - e.g: request messages and response messages
- The **syntax** of the various message types
    - e.g: the fields in the message and how the fields are delineated
- The **semantics** of the fields
    - the meaning of the information in the fields
- Rules for determining **when and how** a process **sends** messages and **responds** to messages
