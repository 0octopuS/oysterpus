# DNS

**Hostname** —such as www.facebook.com, www.google.com—are mnemonic and are therefore appreciated by humans.

But hostname provide little information about the **location** within the Internet of the host. Hosts are also identified by so-called **IP addresses** (full location information).

## 1.Services Provided by DNS

**Domain name system (DNS)** is the dictionary service of Internet. It is

1. a distributed **database** implemented in a hierarchy of **DNS servers**
2. an **application-layer protocol** that allows hosts to **query** the distributed database

The DNS protocol runs over **UDP** and uses port **53**.

DNS adds an additional delay, but the desired IP address is often **cached** in a “nearby” DNS server, which helps to **reduce DNS network traffic** as well as the **average DNS delay**.

!!! note "DNS service"
    1. **Host aliasing**: DNS can be invoked by an application to obtain the **canonical hostname** for a **supplied alias hostname** as well as the **IP address** of the host.
    2. **Mail server aliasing**
    3. **Load distribution**: load distribution among replicated servers. The DNS database contains **a set of IP addresses** relying to **one hostname**. When it responds to client, it rotates the order, so the traffic are distributed. 

## 2.How DNS Works

From the perspective of users, DNS is a **black box** providing a simple translation service.

But in fact, the black box that implements the service is complex, consisting of a large number of **DNS servers** distributed **around the globe**, as well as an application-layer protocol that specifies how the DNS servers and querying hosts **communicate**.

### 2.1 A Distributed, Hierarchical Database

DNS uses a large number of servers, organized in a **hierarchical** fashion and **distributed** around the world.

!!! note "three classes of DNS servers"
    - [root DNS servers](https://root-servers.org/)
        - 1707 instances(in 2023.6.22) , are copies of **13** different root servers, managed by 12 different organizations
    - top-level domain (TLD) DNS servers
        - top-level domains such as `com, org, net, edu, and gov`
        - country top-level domains such as `uk, fr, ca, and jp`
        - maintain by companies like [Verisign](https://www.verisign.com/en_US/domain-names/index.xhtml)(`com,net,cc`),[educause](https://www.educause.edu/)(`edu`)
    - authoritative DNS servers
        - Every organization with **publicly accessible hosts** on the Internet must provide **publicly accessible DNS records** that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses.
        - **implement own** authoritative DNS server or **pay** to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS server
    ---
    - local DNS server
        - A local DNS server **does not** strictly belong to the hierarchy
        - Each **ISP** has a local DNS server
        - When a host connects to an ISP, the ISP provides the host with the **IP addresses of its local DNS servers**(through **DHCP**), forwarding the query into the DNS server hierarchy.

!!! note "**recursive** and **iterative** queries"
    - **iterative**: upper server return message to the client, the client makes a second call. (2-7)
    - **recursive**: chain call, only return the final message(1,8)
    - Normally, the query from the requesting host to the local DNS server is recursive, and the remaining queries are iterative.

### 2.2 DNS Caching

In a query chain, when a **DNS server receives** a DNS reply, it can **cache the mapping in its local memory**.

Because of caching, root servers are **bypassed** for all but a very **small fraction** of DNS queries.

## 3. DNS Records and Messages

!!! note "resource records (RRs)"
    - four tuple: `(Name, Value, Type, TTL)`
    - `TTL` is the **time to live** of the resource record; it determines when a resource should be **removed** from a cache.
    ---
    - `Type=A`
        - `Name` is a hostname, `Value` is the IP address
        - `(relay1.bar.foo.com, 145.37.93.126, A)`
    - `Type=NS`
        - `Name` is a domain (such as foo.com) and `Value` is the hostname of an **authoritative DNS server** that knows how to obtain the IP addresses for hosts in the domain
        - `(foo.com, dns.foo.com, NS)`
    - `Type=CNAME`
        - `Value` is a **canonical hostname** for the alias hostname `Name`.
        - `(foo.com, relay1.bar.foo.com, CNAME)`
    - `Type=MX`
        - `Value` is the `canonical name` of a **mail server** that has an alias hostname `Name`.
        - `(foo.com, mail.bar.foo.com, MX)`

### 3.1 DNS Messages

These are the only **two** kinds of DNS messages. Furthermore, both **query and reply** messages have the **same** format.

<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.DNS.assets\autocb_2.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

- **header section**(12 bytes)
    - identification(16 bit): pair reply - query
    - flag: reply(1)/query(0) -- authoritative -- recursion-desired -- recursion-available
- **question section**
    - a **name** field that contains the name that is being queried.
    - a **type** field that indicates the type of question being asked about the name.
- **answer section**
    - contains the RRs for the name that was originally queried.
- **authority section**
    - contains records of other authoritative servers.
- **additional section**
    - contains other helpful records. eg. canonical hostname


!!! tip "nslookup program"
    - can send a DNS query message **directly** from the host
    <div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./4.DNS.assets\autocb_3.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>


### 3.2 Inserting Records into the DNS Database

!!! note "Step of insert"
    1. register in **registrar**
    2. provide the registrar with the names and **IP addresses** of your primary and secondary a**uthoritative DNS servers**
    3. registrar make sure that a Type NS and a Type A record are entered into the **TLD com servers**.
    4. you make sure that the Type A resource record for your Web server and the Type MX resource record for your mail server are entered into your **authoritative DNS servers**.

A **registrar** is a commercial entity that **verifies the uniqueness** of the domain name, **enters the domain name into the DNS database**, and **collects a small fee** from you for its services.
