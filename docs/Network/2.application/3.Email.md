# Email

Email is an **asynchronous** communication medium. 

Three major components: 

- user agents
- mail server
- the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

## 1. SMTP

SMTP is the principal application-layer protocol for Internet electronic mail, relying on TCP(**persistent** connections).

SMTP **transfers messages** from senders’ mail servers to the recipients’ mail servers.

!!! note "basic operation of SMTP"
    1. A invokes **user agent**, provide B address, composes a message, and instructs the user agent to send the message.
    2. A's user agent sends the message to her **mail server**, where it is placed in a message **queue**.
    3. A's SMTP server sees the message and opens a TCP connection to **B's SMTP server**.
    4. SMTP **handshaking**. A's SMTP server sends message to **TCP connection**.
    5. B's mail server then places the message in **B's mailbox**.
    6. B invokes his user agent to read the message at his convenience.

### 1.1 How SMTP transfers a message?

1. Client SMTP (running on the sending mail server host) has **TCP establish** a connection to port **25** at the server SMTP (running on the receiving mail server host).
2. Handshaking: the SMTP client indicates the e-mail address of the sender and recipient.
3. Client sends the message. Repeats step 3 over the same TCP connection if it has other messages to send to the server.
4. Client instructs TCP to close the connection.

!!! note "SMTP commands"
    HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, CRLF.CRLF, and QUIT

## 2. Mail Formats

Every header must have a `From:` header line and a `To:` header line; a header may include a `Subject:` header line as well as other optional header lines.

``` http
From: alice@crepes.fr
To: bob@hamburger.edu
Subject: Searching for the meaning of life.
 <!-- 1 blank line -->
 message body
```

These header lines are **different** from the SMTP commands.

## 3. Mail Access Protocols

A typical user runs a **user agent on the local host** but accesses its mailbox stored **an always-on *shared* mail server**.

!!! note "Two step SMTP approach"
    agent `-(SMTP)->` mail server `-(SMTP)->` mail server`-(HTTP/IMAP)->` agent
    - Without relaying through Alice’s mail server, Alice’s user agent doesn’t have any recourse to an **unreachable destination mail server**.
    - Alice’s mail server can **repeatedly try** to send the message to Bob’s mail server.

Both the **HTTP and IMAP**(Internet Mail Access Protocol) approaches allow Bob to manage folders, maintained in Bob’s mail server.
