# The Web and HTTP

## 1. HTTP overview

!!! note "Web Concepts"
    - web page: a series of **objects**
    - object: a **file** which is addressable by a **simlple url**
      + an HTML file, a JPEG image, a Javascrpt file, a CCS style sheet file, or a video clip
      + usually a **base HTML file**, several **referenced objects**
    - URL: 2 components: the **hostname** of the server that houses the object and the object’s **path** name.


HTTP defines how Web **clients request** Web pages from Web servers and how **servers transfer** Web pages to clients.

!!! note "HTTP"
    - lying protocols: TCP(data integrity)
    - stateless: no any state information about  clients
    - client-server architecture
    - history
        + HTTP/1.0, 1990s, [RFC 1945]
        + HTTP/1.1, 2020, [RFC 7230]
        + HTTP/2,   now,  [RFC 7540]

## 2. Non-Persistent and Persistent Connections

The series of requests may be made

- back-to-back
- periodically at regular intervals
- intermittently

So designer must decide to use either  

- **non-persistent connections**: each request/response pair be sent over a separate TCP connection
- **persistent connections**(default): all of the requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the same TCP connection?

### 2.1 non-persistent connections

Def: each TCP connection is closed after the server sends the object.(aka: 1 request 1 response)
  
1. client **initiates** a TCP connection (port 80), get corresponding sockets at both client and server
2. client **sends an HTTP request** (includes path name)
3. server **receives** the request, processes, retrieves object from storage, **encapsulates** and s**ends back** in a HTTP response.
4. server tells client to **close** TCP connection.
5. client terminate TCP connection, extracts the files.

HTTP has nothing to do with how a Web page is interpreted by a client.

### 2.2 persistent connections

1. the server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response
2. an entire Web page can be sent over a **single** persistent TCP connection.
3. These requests for objects can be made **back-to-back**, without waiting for replies to pending requests (**pipelining**).
4. HTTP server closes a connection when it isn’t used for **a certain time** (a configurable timeout interval)

## 3. HTTP Message Format

!!! note " general format of HTTP"
    Both request and response consist of:
    ```
    general message = { start-line }
                      { *message -header CRLF } <-(0 or more)
                      { CRLF }
                      { message body } <-(optional)
    ```

### 3.1 request message

An HTTP request message is wriiten in ordinary **ASCII text**:

``` http
GET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.someschool.edu
Connection: close
User-agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept-language: fr
```

1. request line: `{ method | URL | HTTP version }`
      - `method`: GET(majority), POST, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE
2. header line: key-value
      - `Host: www.someschool.edu`, specifies the host on which the object resides
      - `Connection: close`, telling the server to use non-persistent connections
      - `User-agent: Mozilla/5.0`, a Firefox browser
      - `Accept-language: fr`, a French version

<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./2.HTTP.assets\autocb_1.png" style="zoom: 70%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

!!! note "request methods"
      - `GET` method is used when the browser **requests an object**, with the requested object identified in **the URL field**.The `entity body` is empty.
      - `POST` method usually used when user **fill out a form**. The user is still requesting a Web page from the server, but the **specific contents** of the Web page depend on what the user entered into `entity body` fields.
      - `HEAD` method is similar to `GET`, just leaves out objects.
      - `PUT` method is often used in conjunction with Web publishing tools.
      - `DELETE` method allows a user, or an application, to delete an object on a Web server.

### 3.2 response message

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:44:04 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
Last-Modified: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:11:03 GMT
Content-Length: 6821
Content-Type: text/html
(data data data data data ...)
```

1. status line: `{ protocol version | status code | corresponding status message }`
2. header lines
      - `Connection: close`, server will close connection
      - `Date: Tue, ..`, response create time
      - `Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)`, the message was generated by an Apache Web server, analogous to the `User-agent`
      - `Last-Modified: Tue, ...`, indicates the time and date when the object was created or last modified.
      - `Content-Length/Type`, number of bytes in the object, file type.
3. entity body
      - `(data data data data data ...)`, that is the meat, the requested object itself.

<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./2.HTTP.assets\autocb_2.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

!!! note "status code"
    - `1xx`: **informational** - Request received, continuing
    - `2xx`: **success**
        - `200 OK`: Request succeeded and the information is returned in the response.
    - `3xx`: **redirection**
        - `301 Moved Permanently`: Requested object has been permanently moved; the new URL is specified in Location header of the response message. The client software will automatically retrieve the new URL.
    - `4xx`: **client error**
        - `400 Bad Request`: This is a generic error code indicating that the request could not be understood by the server.
        - `404 Not Found`: The requested document does not exist on this server.
    - `5xx`: **Server error**
        - `505 HTTP Version Not Supported`: The requested HTTP protocol version is not supported by the server.

## 4. Cookies

Cookies, defined in [RFC 6265], allow sites to keep track of users.

cookie technology has four components:

1. a cookie **header line** in the HTTP **response** message
2. a cookie **header line** in the HTTP **request** message
3. a **cookie file** kept on the **user’s end** system and managed by the **user’s browser**
4. a **back-end database** at the Web site.

## 5. Web Caching

A **Web cache**—also called a **proxy server**—is a network entity that satisfies HTTP requests **on the behalf of an origin Web server**. They have **own disk storage** to copies of **recently requested** objects.

<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./2.HTTP.assets\autocb_3.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

Client requests to cache first. Only when cache doesn't have the object, it request from origin server (and store the copies).

A cache is both a server and a client at the same time.

!!! note "✅ Web caching advantages"
    1. reduce the **response time** for a client request( high-speed connection between the client and the cache)
    2. reduce **traffic on** an institution’s **access link** to the Internet.


Web caching problem: the copy of an object residing in the cache may be **stale**. HTTP has a mechanism that allows a cache to verify that its objects are **up to date**. This mechanism is called the **conditional GET** [RFC 7232].

- the request message uses the GET method
- the request message includes an `If-Modified-Since`: header line

The cache stores the last-modified date along with the object. Next time retrieval, cahce performs an up-to-date check. Web server's  response like

``` http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Date: Sat, 10 Oct 2015 15:39:29
Server: Apache/1.3.0 (Unix)
(empty entity body)
```

`304 Not Modified` in the status line, which tells the cache that it can go ahead and forward its (the proxy cache’s) cached copy of the object to the requesting browser.

## 6. HTTP/2

Goals for HTTP/2 are 1 web page, 1 TCP connection: 

- to reduce perceived latency by enabling request response **multiplexing** over a single TCP connection
- provide request **prioritization** and server push
- provide efficient **compression** of HTTP header fields.

Main change is how the data is **formatted** and **transported** between the client and server.

!!! note "❌ Head of Line (HOL) blocking problem"
    - Large object will **block** network, take a long time to pass through the bottleneck link. So while the small objects are **delayed** as they wait behind.

### 6.1 HTTP/2 Framing

The HTTP/2 solution for HOL blocking is to break each message into **small frames**, and **interleave(交叉)** the request and response messages on the same TCP connection.

The framing is done by the **framing sub-layer** of the HTTP/2 protocol. 

- The **header field** of the response becomes one frame.
- The **body of the message** is broken down into one for more additional frames.

### 6.2 Response Message Prioritization and Server Pushing

🔘 **Prioritization**

When a client sends concurrent requests to a server, it can **prioritize the responses** it is requesting by a**ssigning a weight between 1 and 256** to each message.The higher number indicates higher priority.

Server can 

- **send first** the frames for the responses with the **highest priority**.
- states each message’s **dependency** on other messages by specifying the ID of the message on which it depends.

🔘 **Pushing**

In addition to the response to the original request, the server can push **additional objects** to the client, before receiving **explicit requests** for these objects.

-> Because HTML base page indicates the objects.

### 6.3 HTTP/3

HTTP/3 is yet a new HTTP protocol that is designed to operate over [QUIC](../3.transport/8.Evolution.md#1-quic-quick-udp-internet-connections).


Features:

- message multiplexing (interleaving)
- per-stream
- flow control
- low-latency connection establishment
