# Socket Programming: Creating Network Applications

network applications types:

1. open: specified in RFC.
2. proprietary: an application-layer protocol that has not been openly published in an RFC or elsewhere.


In `UDP` programming, there is no connection. Every time client's address is attached to its messages.  

```python
message, clientAddress = serverSocket.recvfrom(2048)
```

In `TCP` programming, server needs to specify the connection numbers.

```python
serverSocket.listen(1)
```

And it needs to `accept` a new connection, forms a new `socket`. Every next operation should works in the new socket.


```python
connectionSocket, clientAddress = serverSocket.accept()
# accept(), creating a TCP connection between the clientâ€™s clientSocket and the server's connectionSocket.
message = connectionSocket.recv(2048)
```
