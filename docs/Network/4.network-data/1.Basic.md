# Introduction of Network Layer


- **data-plane**: each router is to forward datagrams from its input links to its output links
- **network-control plane**: coordinate these local, per-router forwarding actions so that datagrams are ultimately transferred end-to-end, along paths of routers between source and destination hosts.

## 1. Forwarding and Routing: The Data and Control Planes

Two important network-layer functions:

- **Forwarding**: move the packet to the appropriate output link; router-local action.
- **Routing**: determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow from a sender to a receiver; network-wide process.

### 1.1 Control Plane: The Traditional Approach

The **routing algorithm** determines the contents of the **routers' forwarding tables**.

Each router having a routing **component** that **communicates with** the routing component of other routers.

### 1.2 Control Plane: The SDN Approach

A physically separate, **remote controller** computes and distributes the forwarding tables.

The routing device performs forward only, and the routing functionality is separated.

The remote controller might be implemented in a remote data center with high **reliability** and **redundancy**, and might be managed by the **ISP** or some    .

## 2. Network Service Model

The network service model defines the **characteristics** of end-to-end delivery of packets between sending and receiving hosts.

The Internet’s network layer provides a single service, known as **best-effort** service， which means **NOTHING** is guaranteed.

- ❌ no guaranteed to be received in order
- ❌ no their eventual delivery
- ❌ no guarantee on the end-to-end delay
- ❌ no minimal bandwidth guarantee
