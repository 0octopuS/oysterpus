# The Internet Protocol (IP): IPv4, Addressing, IPv6, and More

## 1. IPv4 Datagram Format

- IP datagram has a total of **20 bytes** of header.

## 2. IPv4 Addressing

> ❔When we talk about IP address, who owns a IP address?
>
The boundary between the host and the physical link is called an **interface**.

- A host typically has only 1 interface.
- The router has multiple interfaces.

Thus, an **IP address** is technically associated with **an interface**, rather than with the host or router containing that interface.

Each interface on every host and router in the **global Internet** must have an IP address that is globally **unique**(except behind **NAT**).

---


🔘Subnet

A **subnet** is also called an **IP network** or simply, a **network** in the Internet literature.

It's device interfaces that can physically reach each other **without passing through an intervening router**.

🔘 IP address format

Each IP address is **32 bits**  long(equivalently, 4 bytes), and there are thus a total of 232 (or approximately 4 billion) possible IP addresses.

IP address have structure:

- **subnet** part: devices in same subject have **common high order bits**(subnet mask).
- **host part**: **remaining** low order bits.

Based on subnet size, 3 kinds of IP address are defined: 

| IP types | range | amount   | prefix bits |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| A        |       | 16777214 | 8           |
| B        |       | 645534   | 16          |
| C        |       | 254      | 24          |



🔘 CIDR

The Internet’s address assignment strategy is known as **Classless InterDomain Routing** (CIDR—pronounced cider).

- subnet portion of address of arbitrary length
- address format: `a.b.c.d/x`, where `x` is the **prefix**, the portion of subnet bits.

🔘 Special IP address

- 255.255.255.255: all hosts on the same subnet
- 127.0.0.1：loopback address, can only be the destination address of a packet.

## 2.1 Obtaining a Block of Addresses

In order to **obtain a block** of IP addresses for use within an organization’s subnet:

1. Step 1: contact ISP
2. Step 2: ISP provide addresses from a larger block of addresses that had already been allocated to the it.

IP addresses are managed under the authority of the
s.

## 2.2 Obtaining a Host Address: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

Once an organization has obtained a block of addresses, it can **assign individual IP addresses** to the host and router interfaces in its organization.

🔘 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP is a plug-and-play or zeroconf protocol, c-s structure.

- host receives the **same IP address** each time it connects to the network
- host may be assigned a **temporary** IP address that will be **different** each time
- DHCP also allows a host to learn additional information
    - its subnet mask
    - the address of its first-hop router (often called the default gateway)
    - address of its local DNS server


DHCP message:
    - **DHCP discover** [optional]: brodecast to 255.255.255.255
    - **DHCP offer** [optional]: brodecast to 255.255.255.255. Each server offer message contains the transaction ID of the received discover message, the **proposed IP address** for the client, the network mask, and an **IP address lease** time.
    - **DHCP request**: Client chooses one and confirm it to DHCP server, proving its configuration.
    - **DHCP ack**: Server confirming the requested parameters.

## 3. Network Address Translation(NAT)

> ❔ What if we run out of IPv4 address? (Indeed we have already run out.)

🔘 **NAT**

All devices in local network share just **1 IPv4 address** as far as the outside world is concerned. And in **private IP address namespace**, all devices have 32-bits IP address.  

The NAT-enabled router does not look like a router to the outside world. NAT router behaves to the outside world as **a single device** with **a single IP address**.

Advantages:

- Only need 1 IP address from ISP.
- Can change address of host in local network withou notify the outside world.
- Can change ISP without changing address of devices.
- Security: devices inside local net not directly addressable.

Implementation:

- outgoing datagrams: replace `(src IP, port)` to `(NAT IP, new port)`.
- NAT translation table: remember all the translation pair.
- incoming datagrams: replace `(NAT IP, new port)` to `(src IP, port)`.

> ❓ Port numbers are meant to be used for addressing processes, not for addressing hosts. How can one peer connect to another peer that is behind a NAT server?

**NAT traversal**: 1. Find IP address and port which is meaningful to outside world 2. share to the peer.

## 4. IPv6

### 4.1 IPv6 Datagrams Format

The most significant change:

- **Expanded addressing capabilities**: 32 to 128 bits. A new type of address, called an **anycast address**, that allows a datagram to be delivered to any one of a group of hosts.
- **A streamlined 40-byte header**
- **Flow labeling**: labeling of packets belonging to particular flows for which the sender requests special handling, such as a non-default quality of service or real-time service.

### 4.2 Transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6

> ❔How will the public Internet, which is based on IPv4, be transitioned to IPv6?

🔘 Tunneling

**Tunnel** refers to **intervening set of IPv4 routers** between two **IPv6 routers**.

The main idea: IPv6 datagrams are carried as payload between IPv4 routers.
