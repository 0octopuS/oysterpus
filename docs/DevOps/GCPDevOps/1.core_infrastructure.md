## 2. Virtual Machines and Network

## 3. Storage

!!! Note "Take away"
    Five storage products:

    - **[Cloud Storage](./1.core_infrastructure.md#cloud-storage)**: general object
    - **[Cloud SQL](./1.core_infrastructure.md#cloud-sql)**:  relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server
    - **[Cloud Spanner](./1.core_infrastructure.md#cloud-spanner)**: relational database service that scales horizontally
    - **[Firestore](./1.core_infrastructure.md#firestore)**: flexible, horizontally scalable, NoSQL cloud database for mobile, web, and server development. 
    - **[Cloud BigTable](./1.core_infrastructure.md#cloud-bigtable)**: NoSQL Big data database service.

### Cloud Storage

🔘 **Use case**: BLOB for online contents(video, images...)

🔘 **Object storage**: is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as “Objectives” and not as a file and folder hierarchy (file storage), or as chunks of a disk (block storage).

<div class="autocb" style="text-align:center;"><img src="./1.core_infrastructure.assets\autocb_0.png" style="zoom: 50%;box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 10px 10px 10px; border-radius: 10px;" /></div>

🔘 **Components**: Cloud Storage files are organized into **buckets**. Choose ideal location for a bucket is where latency is minimized.

🔘 **Immutability of Objectives**: The storage Objectives offered by Cloud Storage are **immutable**. To update, either **overwrite**, or using **versioning** to keep track of previous file.

🔘 **ACL**: IAM is sufficient in most cases, roles are inherited from project to bucket to object. For finer control, ACLs can be created with [Scope, Permission].

🔘 **Tiers of Storage**

| Type             | Use(read/modify) Frequency |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Standard Storage | Hot data                   |
| Nearline Storage | 30 days                    |
| Coldline Storage | 90 days                    |
| Archive Storage  | 1 year                     |

### Cloud SQL

Cloud SQL includes MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

🔘 **Mundane but necessary tasks**: GCP manage applying patches and updates, managing backups, and configuring replications.

🔘 **Location and accessibility**: can be configure to near Compute Engines. Could SQ can be accessed by other google Cloud services and even external services.

### Cloud Spanner

🔘 **Use cases**

- A SQL relational database management system with joins and secondary indexes.
- Built-in high availability
- Strong global consistency
- High numbers of input and output operations per second.

### Firestore

Data is stored in documents and then organized into collections.

🔘 **Compare to mongodb**

- MongoDB accepts query language to retrieve data, but Firestore has its own method and API calls. 
- Firestore has advantage in data synchronization. The capability to update and listen to changes in the database in **real-time** is pretty neat when working with web/mobile applications, giving all the users the feeling they are updated all the time.

### Cloud BigTable

Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput.

## 4. Container

!!! note "Take Away"
    - Container is PaaS. 
    - Kubernetes is for managing and scaling containerized applications.

### Container

🔘 A container, is an invisible box around your code and its dependencies with limited access to its own partition of the file system and hardware.

### Kubernetes

🔘 Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services.
 Kubernetes is **a set of APIs** that you can use to deploy containers on a set of nodes called a cluster.

🔘 **Terminal in Kubernetes**

- A **node** represents a computing instance like a machine.
- A **pod** is the smallest unit in Kubernetes that you can create or deploy. It represents a **running process** on your cluster as either a component of your application or an entire app. Generally 1 container for 1 pod. The pod provides a unique network IP and set of ports for your containers.
- A **deployment** represents a group of replicas of the same pod and keeps your pods running even when the nodes they run on fail.
- A **service** is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them.
- A **service group** is a set of pods and provides a stable endpoint or fixed IP address for them.

🔘 Structure of Kubernetes

### GKE(Google Kubernetes Engine)

🔘 GKE is a Google hosted managed Kubernetes service in the cloud.

🔘 Some features GCP provides

- **Load balancing** for compute engine instances
- node pools to **designate subsets** of nodes within a cluster
- Automatic **scaling** of your cluster's node instance count
- Automatic **upgrades** for your cluster's node software
- Node auto-repair to maintain **node health** and availability
- **Logging** and monitoring with Google Cloud's operation suite 


## 5. Application

!!! note "Take Away"
    - Cloud Run and Cloud Functions are serverless.
    - Cloud Run is for application.
    - Cloud Function is for a single purpose function.


🔘 Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that runs **stateless container**s via web requests or pub/sub events.

🔘 Cloud Run workflow: write code -> build package -> deploy. Cloud Run then starts your container on demand and dynamically scaling with requests amount.

🔘 Cloud Function require no management of server or a runtime environment.
