# Getting Started with Terraform for Google Cloud

Terraform is an open source, Infrastructure as Code tool by HashiCorp, for provisioning resources â€“ including Google Cloud resources â€“ with **declarative configuration files**.

## 1. Introduction to Terraform for Google Cloud

ðŸ”˜ Infrastructure as code(IaC): declare the **desired end state** of the infrastructure â€“IaC handles management and provisioning.

ðŸ”˜ Terraform: Terraform allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple, human-readable language called HashiCorp Configuration Language, or HCL. Terraform reads configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be reviewed, applied, and provisioned.

ðŸ”˜ IaC configuration workflow

## 2. Terms and Concepts

### Terraform configuration and HCL

- A **Terraform configuration** is a complete document in the Terraform language that tells Terraform how to manage a given collection of infrastructure.
  - Store in .tf file.
  - Modules: A root module(root configuration file), And an optional tree for child modules.
- **HashiCorp Configuration Language**(HCL): a JSON-based variant. HCL includes a limited set of primitives such as `variables`, `resources`, `outputs`, and `modules`.

```HCL
<Block Type> <Block Label> <Block Label> {
    <Identifier> = <Expression>
}
```

### Author phase terms and concepts

- **Resources** are code blocks that define the infrastructure components. `resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_name" {...}`
- **Providers** implement every resource type

     ``` HCL
     terraform{
        required_providers{ 
            google={ 
                source = "hashicorp/google",
            }
        }
     }

     provider "google { project = <PROJECT>, region=<PROJECT_REGION>}
     ```

- **Variables** are used to parameterize your configuration.  define a resource attribute at run time or centrally in a file with a `.tfvar` file.
- **Output** values are a way to expose some of that configuration information.

    ```HCL
    output "bucket_URL"{
        value = google_storage_bucket.mybucket.URL
    }
    ```  

- Terraform saves the state of resources that it manages in a state file(**terraform.tfstate**). Do not modify or touch this file; itâ€™s created and updated automatically.
- a **Terraform module** is a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory.

### Terraform commands

```shell
terraform init # a hidden directory called terraform is created inside the current working directory. It will initialize provider plugins.
terraform plan # creates an execution plan detailing all the resources that will be created, modified, or destroyed upon executing terraform apply.
terraform apply # executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan, creates the resources, and establishes the dependencies.
terraform destroy # Terraform determines the order in which things must be destroyed.
terraform validate # validate runs checks that verify whether a configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent
terraform fmt #applies all formatting rules and recommended styles to assist with readability and consistency.
```

### Terraform validator

!!! note inline end "terraform validate vs terraform validator"

    - `terraform validate` command checks grammar.
    - The Terraform Validator is used to ensure that the configuration adheres to the set of constraints.   

The Terraform validator is a tool for **enforcing policy compliance** as part of an infrastructure CI/CD pipeline.

```shell
gcloud beta terraform vet
```

The tool **retrieves project data** with Google Cloud APIs, so you can accurately validate your plan.
